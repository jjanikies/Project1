        <p> Learn South America partners with various colleges and universities across the United States to teach Business and Economic students about Emerging Economies throughout South America. Through this program you will have the opportunity to live in Argentina and Chile, as well as visit Peru and learn about the current economic successes and struggles of each economy. Not only will students learn about the economy, but students will also have time to travel throughout the countries and become apart of the culture.</p>
